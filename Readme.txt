Hi!

Thanks for downloading my app and help me out to distribute it all over the NET.
Now on I will explain how it works:

*********************************************************************************

- This is a result from an experiment using VEmesh E2D IoT hardware, 
  but what's that?

  - VEmesh E2D is a kind of RF technology to apply on LED networks.
    Basically every LED luminaire has got a driver which controls it and
    that's connected to an E2D node.

  - Main idea is to send byte datagrams to a RF brigde that will repeat it
    among the E2D nodes, whereas the data is retransmitted to any LED driver.

  - If you want to know more about it, 
    have a look at https://virtual-extension.com/products/iot-products/
    or send me a MP.

- Our network was quite small because we'd got in mind not to use VEmesh cloud
  to monitor our stuff, so here's the result.

- Nevertheless, we got success at shutting down, turning on and commissioning of
  our beloved luminaires.
